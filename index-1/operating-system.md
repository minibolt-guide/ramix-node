# 1.2 Operating system

We configure the Raspberry Pi and install the official operating system.

## Which operating system to use?

We use Raspberry Pi OS bookworm (Debian 12 based), without a graphical user interface. This provides the best stability for the PC and makes the initial setup a breeze.

Raspberry Pi OS is based on the [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) Linux distribution, which is available for most hardware platforms. To make this guide as universal as possible, it uses only standard Debian-based commands.
