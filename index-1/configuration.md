# 1.4 Configuration

You are now on the command line of your own Bitcoin node. Let's start with the configuration.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/configuration.jpg" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Enable PCIe and Gen 3.0 (only Raspberry Pi 5 + NVMe case)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you connected the SSD directly to the USB (**more common**), and you won't use M.2 NVMe drive, you can skip these steps and go to the [Install general dependency packages](configuration.md#install-general-dependency-packages) section
{% endhint %}

By default, the PCIe connector is not enabled **unless connected to a** [**HAT+ device**](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/m2-hat-plus/). To enable the connector, follow these steps.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you connected **a** [HAT+ device](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/m2-hat-plus/), skip this step and go directly to the next [PCIe Gen 3.0](configuration.md#pcie-gen-3.0) section
{% endhint %}

Raspberry Pi 5 uses Gen 2.0 speeds (5 GT/s) by default. Apply the next config to force Gen 3.0 (8 GT/s) speeds (if the peripheral board and M.2 NVMe drive support (more common)) and enable the PCIe port.&#x20;

-> 2 different methods:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="via config.txt" %}
* Edit the `config.txt` file

```bash
sudo nano +52 /boot/firmware/config.txt
```

* Add the following line at the end of the file behind the `[all]` section. Save and exit

```
dtparam=pciex1_gen=3
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="via raspi-config" %}
* Run the following command to open the Raspberry Pi Configuration CLI

```bash
sudo raspi-config
```

Complete the following steps to enable PCIe Gen 3.0 speeds:

1. Select `6 Advanced Options`

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/rapi-config_6_Advanced_options.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

2. Select `A8 PCIe Speed`

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/rapi-config_A8_PCIe_Speed.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

3. Choose `Yes` to enable PCIe Gen 3 mode

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/pcie_gen3_confirmation.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

4. Select `Finish` to exit
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

* Reboot for the configuration changes to take effect

```bash
sudo reboot
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
The Raspberry Pi 5 is not certified for Gen 3.0 speeds. PCIe Gen 3.0 connections may be unstable. If you have problems, follow the next [Fallback Gen 3.0](configuration.md#fallback-gen-3.0) section

#### Fallback Gen 3.0

* If you followed the before `"via config.txt"` method, replace `dtparam=pciex1_gen=3` to `dtparam=pciex1` and reboot again with `sudo reboot`
* If you followed the before `"via raspi-config"` method, when you arrive to the step number 3, choose `No`and finally reboot again with `sudo reboot`
{% endhint %}

## System update

* Update the operating system and all installed software packages. Press "**y**" and `enter` or directly `enter` when the prompt asks you

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Do this regularly for security-related updates
{% endhint %}

## Install general dependency packages

* Make sure that all necessary global software packages are installed. Press "**y**" and `enter` or directly `enter` when the prompt asks you

```bash
sudo apt install git
```

## Check drive performance

Performant unit storage is essential for your node. Let's check if your drive works well as-is, or if additional configuration is needed.

* Install the software to measure the performance of your drive. Press "**y**" and `enter` or directly `enter` when the prompt asks you

```bash
sudo apt install hdparm
```

* Your external disk should be detected as `/dev/sda` if you use SSD or `/dev/nvme0n1` if you use NVMe. Check if this is the case by listing the names of connected block devices

```sh
lsblk -pli
```

#### Measure the speed of your drive depending on your case:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Case USB SSD (more common)" %}
Measure the speed of your drive

```bash
sudo hdparm -t --direct /dev/sda
```

**Example** of expected output:

```
Timing O_DIRECT disk reads: 932 MB in 3.00 seconds = 310.23 MB/sec
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If the speed of your USB3 drive is not acceptable, we need to configure the USB driver to ignore the UAS interface

-> Check the [Fix bad USB3 performance](../troubleshooting.md#fix-bad-usb3-performance) entry in the [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting.md) guide to learn how
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Case NVMe" %}
Measure the speed of your drive

```bash
sudo hdparm -t --direct /dev/nvme0n1
```

**Example** of expected output:

```
Timing O_DIRECT disk reads: 2422 MB in 3.00 seconds = 806.86 MB/sec
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="success" %}
If the measured speeds are more than 150 MB/s, you're good but it is recommended more for a better experience
{% endhint %}

## Data directory

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to boot from microSD instead of an external drive, here you need to go to the [System configuration](../bonus-guides/system/boot-from-microsd-instead-of-external-drive.md#system-configuration) of the [Boot from microSD instead of an external drive](../bonus-guides/system/boot-from-microsd-instead-of-external-drive.md) and follow those steps, instead of continuing with this section. When you finish, skip to the [Security](security.md) section directly
{% endhint %}

We'll store all application data in the dedicated directory `/data`. This allows for better security because it's not inside any user's home directory. Additionally, it's easier to move that directory somewhere else, for instance to a separate drive, as you can just mount any storage option to `/data`

* Create the data folder

```sh
sudo mkdir /data
```

* Assing to the `admin` user as the owner of the **`/data`** folder

```sh
sudo chown admin:admin /data
```

## Resize the swap file <a href="#increase-swap-file-size" id="increase-swap-file-size"></a>

The swap file acts as slower memory and is essential for system stability. The standard size of 200M is way too small.

* Edit the configuration file

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile
</strong></code></pre>

* Comment on the entry `CONF_SWAPSIZE` by placing a "`#"` symbol in front of it. Save and exit

```
#CONF_SWAPSIZE=512
```

{% hint style="info" %}
It will then be created dynamically to use Â½ of the total RAM size installed
{% endhint %}

* Recreate new swapfile

```bash
sudo systemctl restart dphys-swapfile
```

* Check the new swap size

```bash
swapon --show
```

Example of expected output:

```
NAME      TYPE SIZE USED PRIO
/var/swap file   2G   0B   -2
```
